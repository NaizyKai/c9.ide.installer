    <h3>This installation wizard will set up Cloud9 IDE on your workspace</h3>
    <p>
        Cloud9 IDE has a set of dependencies that it needs to run on an SSH 
        workspace. We have chosen to install these dependencies in the ~/.c9
        directory on your machine. To prevent conflicts with different versions
        of the software we will install all the dependencies there
        regardless of what is already installed. To remove c9
        from your machine, simply remove the ~/.c9 folder and you're done.
    </p>
        
    <p>We will install the following dependencies:</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li>Node.js - Runs our agent</li>
        <li>Tmux - Makes smart terminals</li>
        <li>Pty.js - Needed for terminals as well</li>
        <li>Nak - Does search and lists of files</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>
        You can choose to do this installation automatically or you
        can run the installation script manually. This installation is required
        to run Cloud9 IDE.
    </p>
    
    <p>Would you like Cloud9 IDE to run the install script for you?</p>
