<h3>Can we quickly set up Cloud9 on your workspace?</h3>
<p>Cloud9 needs a few dependencies to be able to work with this SSH workspace.</p>

<p>If you agree, we’ll install a few things in the ~/.c9 folder.</p>
<p>This will not affect any other part of your system, it’s fully self-contained!</p>

<h4>How can I revert this later?</h4>
<p>
    To fully remove Cloud9 from your machine, all you need to do is 
    remove the ~/.c9 folder! Nothing will be left over on your system.
